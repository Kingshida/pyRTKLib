# ToDo List

- integrate u-Blox conversion in `pyconvbin.py`
- separate the signals according to the frequency band
    + name these files with appending the frequency band, e.g. GALI1340-E1.19O, BEGP1340-E6.19O
    + process per frequency band
- in PRS data
    + E28 == E33
    + E29 == E36
    + adjust PRN numbers in RINEX obs file
